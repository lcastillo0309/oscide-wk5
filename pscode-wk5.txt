// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

x = 4
y = 5
print(x + y)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(num = input
if: num /2
print('this number is even')
else:
print('this number is odd')
)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 
num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,]  
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
avg = sum(num)/len(num)
print(avg)
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
print(min(1))
print(max(5))
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

For B was getting the average number from the 5 variables/numbers we wrote down and the average was 3.

C is showing what is the lowest number of the 5 which the lowest number is 1 and the highest is 5.
